// Single source of truth for every EngineFixes setting.
//
// Each entry is  X(type, key, default, comment)  where:
//   type    - REX::TOML scalar type: Bool / I32 / U32 / F32
//   key     - the TOML key (also the C++ variable name; section is fixed per list)
//   default - the default value (a C++ literal of the matching type)
//   comment - the description emitted into EngineFixes.toml
//
// These lists drive BOTH the runtime bindings (settings.h) AND the self-healing
// EngineFixes.toml generator (settings.cpp). Because both derive from here, the
// declared settings and the generated TOML can never drift apart -- the bug that
// previously left new keys (e.g. bLockpickingMenuInitCrash) out of the shipped
// TOML. To add a setting, add ONE line to the appropriate list below.
